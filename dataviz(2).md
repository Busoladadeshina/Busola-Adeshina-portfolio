I chose this visualization because it tells a story of the top 10 countries with the highest debt to GDP ratio. 
I used a legend to show countries and highlighted Japan (i.e the country with the highest debt to GDP ratio) red which is usually associated with a warning sign to distinguish it from other countries.
