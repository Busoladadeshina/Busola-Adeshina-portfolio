Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data.

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  I really like data.  And I like visualizations.  So I guess you can say that I like data visualizations!

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. Creating good data visualization with Tableau
2. Have a publicly accessible portfolio
3. Learn how to tell a compelling story with data


# Portfolio

You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it.
