This Barchart visualizes the general government debt of countries overtime by the OECD. It is arranged in descending order with Japan being the country with the highest debt and Korea being the least.

This Heatmap shows and ranks countries general government debt overtime. The highest debt to GDP ratio is marked with deep red signaling a warning sign and the least debt to GDP ratio is blue. The gradient colour is used to see trend easily as debt to GDP ratio increases.

# Top 10 Countries with the Highest Debt-to-GDP Ratios

This visualization highlights the top 10 countries with the highest debt-to-GDP ratios. It provides a quick comparison of the countries with the largest government debt relative to their GDP. Japan, the country with the highest debt to GDP ratio is highlighted in red.

## Data Source:
- **OECD**: General Government Debt-to-GDP Ratio - [OECD Data](https://www.oecd.org/en/data.html).

## DATA DESCRIPTION:
I chose this visualization because it tells a story of the top 10 countries with the highest debt to GDP ratio. 
I used a legend to show countries and highlighted Japan (i.e the country with the highest debt to GDP ratio) red which is usually associated with a warning sign to distinguish it from other countries. 
It differs from the heatmap because only the country of interest with the highest Debt to GDP ratio is highlighted with red showing caution. However, similarly to the heatmap it ranks countries by their debt to GDP ratios. I also put the other countries with in grey to prevent clashing colour contrast and place focus on Japan. I also only included information that tells the story my title already describes.
 
## Comparison between the three charts
The barchart, heatmap and line graph all tells a story of countries general government debt accross years. However, I think choosing a subset of the entire data (i.e top 10 countries), highlighting the country with the highest debt in red and utilizing the legend to rank the top 10 countries in descending order as done in the line graph catches your attention and makes it easier to see the country with the highest government debt. Additionally, heatmap was a good way to show debt progression across years and arranging them in a descending order makes the highest value jump at you than compared to the initial barchart.
