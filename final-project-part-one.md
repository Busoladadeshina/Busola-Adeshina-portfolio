# WHY THE US SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO SICKLE CELL DISEASE?
## A case for increased attention and funding for Sickle Cell Disease Research in the US.

# Outline
## High level summary
This project aims to highlight the urgent need for increased attention and funding for sickle cell disease (SCD) research in the United States. Sickle cell disease an inherited blood disorder that affects hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. The disease is predominantly common in countries in sub-saharan africa and the Carribean usually associated with Malaria. 

Sickle cell disease affects approximately 100,000 Americans (primarily Black/African Americans) which represents about 0.03% of the total U.S. population (assuming a population of around 330 million). It is important to note that while these percentages may seem small to the overall population, Sickle Cell Disease has a significant impact on those affected and their families, with serious health complications and reduced life expectancy.

Despite the steady growing number of deaths due to sickle cell anemia in the United States from 2018 to 2022, very little has been done in making strides towards it's cure. This is due to the disproportionately less attention and funding Sickle Cell Disease has received compared to other genetic disorders. Recent scientific breakthroughs, particularly in gene therapy, have opened new avenues for potential cures. However, significant challenges persist particularly regarding accessibility and affordability.

By prioritizing Sickle Cell Disease research, we have a unique opportunity to address a major health disparity affecting minority communities, potentially cure a debilitating genetic disorder and reduce long-term healthcare costs associated with the treatment.

## Project Structure:
1. Brief overview of Sickle Cell Disease and its prevalence in the US
2. Sickle Cell Disease Impact on American Health care
- More than 90% of people in the United States with Sickle Cell Disease are non-Hispanic Black or African American, and an estimated 3%â€“9% are Hispanic or Latino.
- A more recent study estimates that the total number of Sickle Cell Disease cases in 50 states and Washington D.C. in the US was 120,156 cases in 2020. This represent about 0.036% of the U.S. population.
- The overall SCD birth prevalence in the U.S. is estimated at 1 in 2,024 newborns (approximately 0.049% of all newborns)
- Visualization showing how Sickle Cell Diseases disproportionately affects different racial groups (affects 1 in 365 Black or African-American births and 1 in 16,300 Hispanic American births) 
3. Annual economic impact of sickle cell disease: $1.1 billion in healthcare costs
4. Analysis using visual comparison showing how Sickle Cell Disease receives significantly less funding than other genetic disorders including cystic fibrosis, despite it affecting three times as many people in the US.
5. Analysis of racial disparities in medical research funding
6. Recent Breakthroughs showing A Turning Point in Sickle Cell Disease Treatment
- FDA approval of gene therapies Casgevy and Lyfgenia in December 2023
- Potential for CRISPR gene-editing to provide a functional cure
7. Barriers to Progress
- High cost of new therapies: Estimated $2 million per treatment
- Limited access to specialized care centers, especially in rural areas
8. The Economic Case for investment in Sickle Cell Disease Research Funding
- Potential reduction in lifetime healthcare costs for Sickle Cell patients
- Increased workforce productivity with improved patient health outcomes
9. Policy Recommendations
- Increase NIH funding for Sickle Cell Disease research by 50% over the next 5 years
- Create tax incentives for pharmaceutical companies to invest in Sickle Cell Disease cure research
- Expand Medicaid coverage for Sickle Cell Disease treatments and specialized care
10. Potential Outcomes of Increased Investment
- Accelerated development of affordable cures
- Reduced healthcare disparities for minority communities
- Long-term savings for federal health programs

## Story arc



## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium
I plan to create an interactive presentation using Shorthand, with embedded Tableau visualizations using data representations. Shorthand will allow for a visually engaging narrative flow, while Tableau will enable the creation of more interactive data visualizations. This combination will help effectively communicate the urgency of addressing Sickle Cell Disease to policymakers, healthcare providers, and the general public. It allows me to tell a compelling story on why more funding should be given to sickle cell disease and provides detail required for a policymaker like a U.S. Senator who sits on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee who have significant influence over health policy and research funding to advocate and act on the issue. The data visualization produced would also be suitable to use for presentations.
